# `seedrandom`

**Area:** Determinism / reproducible sampling

## Why this matters for PairOfCleats
Deterministic PRNG streams for sampling, shuffling, and any randomized heuristics in indexing pipelines.

## Implementation notes (practical)
- Seed per run/repo to make results reproducible and debuggable.
- Avoid global seeding unless you control all call sites.

## Where it typically plugs into PairOfCleats
- Sampling: deterministic selection of 'neighbor context' or exemplars for summaries.

## Suggested extraction checklist
- [x] Identify the exact API entrypoints you will call and the data structures you will persist. (Use `seedrandom(seed)` to create deterministic RNG for query generation (tools/bench/query-generator.js).)
- [x] Record configuration knobs that meaningfully change output/performance. (Seed string controls deterministic output (tools/bench/query-generator.js).)
- [x] Add at least one representative test fixture and a regression benchmark. (Fixture: benchmarks/queries/*.txt generated by tools/bench/query-generator.js. Benchmark: tools/bench/language-repos.js.)
