- Source: https://github.com/github/stack-graphs
- Type: repo

## Summary
- Rust implementation of the stack graphs algorithm for name resolution.
- Designed for fast, incremental, cross-file symbol binding.

## PairOfCleats takeaways
- Evaluate stack graphs for scalable name resolution.
- Use incremental name binding to avoid full reindexing.
