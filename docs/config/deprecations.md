# Config Deprecations

The config schema (`docs/config/schema.json`) is authoritative. It does not
carry deprecated-but-accepted keys; unknown keys are rejected.

## Active deprecations
- (none)

## Removed keys
If you are migrating a legacy config, compare it against the current schema
and update keys accordingly. Legacy renames are no longer tracked here to
avoid drifting out of sync with the validated surface.
