# Solo issue repairs — 2026-10-25

## Scope and execution policy

Continue on `codex/pr557-audit-repairs-20261012` and PR #572, using Node
26.12.1 on Windows. The user resumed implementation first on October 25:
batch related open issues, defer test execution until implementation is ready,
and commit/push completed source batches. No workers, worktrees, Linux/WSL,
elevation, security-setting changes, physical-link creation or merge is included.
Formatting and static/generated checks continue. Authored regressions below are
unvalidated unless a later source-bound receipt explicitly records execution.

The live GitHub intake contains **763 open issues**: P1 31, P2 336, P3 46,
Perf 115 and other/unprioritized 235. There are no P0/P4 reports in this snapshot.
Titles determine priority. This is an open-issue inventory, not a claim that
every open report has been independently reviewed or fixed. Existing PR coverage
and historical receipts remain separate from GitHub open/closed state.

## Completed implementation batches

- **#1746: VFS I/O benchmark deletion ownership.** `--outDir` selects a parent;
  the benchmark exclusively creates a unique child, uses exclusive file writes,
  joins every started writer before cleanup and starts no subsequent batch after
  failure. It rechecks admitted parent/root identities and removes only that
  child. Invalid modes fail before filesystem work. Cleanup failures preserve
  the original work error as cause and retain the refused run directory.
  `tests/perf/bench/vfs-io-ownership.test.js` covers the actual CLI, unrelated
  parent bytes, retained outputs, concurrent runs, held/failing writers and
  cleanup refusal. Execution is deferred.
- **Validation fixture repairs carried forward.** The completed-stage schema
  negative now constructs an explicitly unobserved producer, rather than
  deleting an optional reason from the observed checkout identity. Native job
  selection uses the current producer's exact disabled/expired-selection
  diagnostics. Native search fixture publication now receives the same explicit
  cache root as its isolated CLI child; parent environment configuration cannot
  silently redirect the fixture's artifacts. Assertions remain intact; rechecks
  are deferred.

## Remaining work

Implement remaining priority defects before perf/unprioritized work, retaining
the existing issue mappings and authored coverage. Finish the interrupted
Windows validation selection and resolve its outstanding export deadlines and
native lifecycle cases when execution resumes. Preserve the original failure
receipts and distinguish mixed-source passing observations from acceptance of
the final candidate. Update PR #572 with source batches and exact validation
status; no all-issues or whole-suite closure is claimed here.
