# Archived Docs

This folder contains deprecated or superseded spec and design documents. Do not edit these as live specifications.

## Rules
- Move replaced specs here instead of deleting them.
- Keep the original filename unless there is a collision.
- Add a short DEPRECATED header in the archived file with:
  - the canonical replacement(s)
  - the reason for deprecation
  - the date and PR (or commit) that performed the change

## Example header
DEPRECATED: Replaced by docs/specs/example-spec.md
Reason: Consolidated into canonical spec
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
PR: <link or commit>
