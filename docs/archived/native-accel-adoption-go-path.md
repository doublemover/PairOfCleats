# DEPRECATED
- Canonical replacement: `docs/specs/native-accel.md`
- Reason: native acceleration adoption path closed with explicit no-go decision; JS runtime remains the only active path.
- Date and commit: 2026-02-21T00:00:00Z, pending commit on `STARFALL_CITADEL`

# Native Acceleration Go-Path Notes (Archived)

This document previously tracked the planned native adoption path (bitmap/top-k/ANN/worker offload cutover).
The plan is archived and inactive. Production behavior does not include native acceleration.
