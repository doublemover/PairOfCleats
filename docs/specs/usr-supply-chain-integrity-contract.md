# Spec -- USR Supply Chain Integrity Contract

Status: Draft v0.1
Last updated: 2026-02-11T04:05:00Z

## 0. Purpose and scope

Defines integrity protections for toolchains parsers and dependencies.

This contract extends docs/specs/unified-syntax-representation.md and must remain consistent with roadmap gates in TES_LAYN_ROADMAP.md.

## 1. Normative requirements

1. Define lockfile signature and attestation requirements for critical components.
2. Define tamper detection and fail-closed policy for integrity violations.
3. Define emergency response and recovery protocol for compromised dependencies.
4. Implementations MUST emit explicit diagnostics for unsupported or degraded execution paths in this domain.
5. Strict-mode behavior MUST fail closed when blocking constraints in this contract are violated.

## 2. Determinism and compatibility requirements

- Outputs and validations defined by this contract MUST be deterministic for identical input and runtime policy.
- Contract changes MUST be versioned and assessed for backward-compat impact before rollout.
- Non-strict allowances MUST remain explicitly diagnosable and auditable.

## 3. Required evidence outputs

- usr-supply-chain-integrity-contract-validation.json
- usr-supply-chain-integrity-contract-drift-report.json
- usr-release-readiness-scorecard.json linkage entry for this contract domain

## 4. Cross-contract dependencies

- docs/specs/usr-security-and-data-governance-contract.md
- docs/specs/usr-operational-runbook-contract.md
- docs/specs/usr-registry-schema-contract.md
- docs/specs/usr-audit-and-reporting-contract.md

## 5. Governance notes

- Domain owners MUST define blocking and advisory gates for this contract in roadmap phase checklists.
- Waivers for this domain MUST use docs/specs/usr-waiver-and-exception-contract.md and be time-bounded.

## Required Fields and Tables

- Implementations MUST maintain a machine-readable table for each normative row class in this contract domain.
- Required tables MUST include stable identifiers, owner metadata, and blocking/advisory classification fields.

## Invalid Cases

- Missing required keys, unknown blocking enums, and incompatible schemaVersion MUST be invalid.
- Invalid cases MUST produce deterministic diagnostics and reason codes.

## Cross-Contract Conflict Resolution

- Conflicts between this contract and other decomposed contracts MUST be resolved via change-management workflow.
- If unresolved, umbrella USR spec precedence applies and promotion is blocked.

## Ownership and Escalation

- Primary and backup owners MUST be declared in ownership matrices.
- Escalation routing for blocking failures MUST follow the operational runbook contract.

## Change Log

- v0.1: initial draft baseline for this contract.

## Success Metrics

- Blocking-failure count for this contract domain MUST trend to zero before promotion.
- Deterministic rerun consistency for domain checks MUST remain within configured drift budget.

## Non-goals

- This contract does not replace umbrella USR semantics in docs/specs/unified-syntax-representation.md.
- This contract does not authorize bypass of strict-mode blocking behavior unless an active waiver exists.

## Rollout Behavior

- New requirements in this contract MUST be rolled out through shadow, dual-read/write, and cutover where applicable.
- Rollout deviations MUST be tracked with time-bounded waivers.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Required machine-readable rows defined and validated.
- [ ] Blocking/advisory gates mapped and enforced.
- [ ] Required evidence artifacts emitted and linked in scorecard.
- [ ] Drift checks green.

## Canonical Examples

- Include at least one minimal valid example and one maximal typical example for this contract domain.
- Examples MUST be deterministic and compatible with declared schema versions.
