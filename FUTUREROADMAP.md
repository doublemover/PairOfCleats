# PairOfCleats FutureRoadmap

This document is now a thin pointer to the canonical active roadmap.

## Authoritative active roadmap

- `AINTKNOWMAP.md` is the single active and authoritative implementation sequence.

## Canonical command/path locks

- Canonical release runner command/file: `node tools/release/check.js` (script alias `npm run release-check`).
- Canonical test ownership rule: one canonical test path per concern.

## Decision registers

- Decision registers were resolved on 2026-02-20 and are tracked in `AINTKNOWMAP.md` execution updates.

## Legacy roadmap snapshot

- Historical duplicated roadmap content was moved to `docs/archived/FUTUREROADMAP-legacy.md`.
- That archived snapshot is non-authoritative and retained only for historical auditability.
