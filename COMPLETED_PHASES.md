# Completed Phases 

Any time a phase is fully completed, AFTER it has been merged into main:
  - The numbering and ordering of phases does not matter whatsoever
  - Remove the phase from the current roadmap
  - Append the Title and a brief, single item summary 
  - Some phase numbers are reused 
  - Nothing in this document should be treated as authoritative, refer to code for truth

Completed phase snapshots are archived here after being removed from GIGAROADMAP.md.
