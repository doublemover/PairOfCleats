# Phase 10 Plan

- [x] Fix watch debounce async error handling
- [x] Enforce records exclusion from other indexes (like extracted-prose)
- [x] Replace localeCompare with deterministic ordering; add determinism regression check
- [x] Add cache schema/version to incremental signatures (derived) and validate
- [x] Run focused tests (build-index-all, indexer signatures, sort determinism, watch debounce, watch filter)
