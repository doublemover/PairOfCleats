where we're going...

- [ ] Needs packages, package lock
- [ ] Needs a branch for the rust version of the search utility
  - [ ] Need to figure out workflows for this
- [ ] Copy .gitignore style for folder/file exclusion
- [ ] Refine build index defaults, introduce additional options
  - [ ] Lower default embedding model
- [ ] Refine search defaults, introduce additional options
- [ ] Index building stats
- [ ] Clean up workflow and scripts

Chunk Data
- [ ] Need start and end line numbers
- [ ] Json enhance

Indexing
- [ ] Better YAML parsing
- [ ] Go deeper into JS AST to expose more
- [ ] Better HTML/CSS parsing
- [ ] Check out bash parsing
- [ ] See about other language support
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] C/C++/ObjC
  - [ ] Swift
  - [ ] Rust
- [ ] Look into consuming missed queries for synonym maps / 'must' chunks if hits
- [ ] Specify additional branches

Benchmarking
- [ ] Need to look into trying out minimum - maximum estimated viable chunk size and dimension configurations using terms from search history and compare results against metrics
- [ ] Need to look into how best to evaluate coding agent performance with and without the tool
