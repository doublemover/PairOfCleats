# Sundial Roadmap

A short roadmap for the Appendix A remediation work in this worktree.

## Now
- Close remaining Appendix A P0/P1 fixes in the indexing build pipeline (see `PLAN_APPENDIX_A.md`).

## Next
- Tackle determinism and correctness fixes in postings, file-meta, and shards.
- Add or adjust tests that lock in the artifact behaviors.

## Later
- Work through Appendix A P2 items and embedding/ANN follow-ups.
